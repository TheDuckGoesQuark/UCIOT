## Routing Methods

 Random Walks
Probabilistic load balancing.
- Simple
- Low memory and computation cost 
- Unrealistic topologies

 Multipath
Maintain multiple paths between nodes to reduce traffic on 'best' routes
- Inherent load balancing
- More computation and memory footprint

## Processes

 Changing locators
- Update local knowledge of own locator values
- Inform active correspondent nodes (CNs) of the changes
- ID does not change. Immutable.

 Neighbourhood Discovery
- Apparently IPv6 method can be used
